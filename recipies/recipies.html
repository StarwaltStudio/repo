            <h3>Directions</h3>
        </ul>
<h4>
    <ul>
        <div class="box" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 600px;">
        <li>Remember you wont be using the oven for a few hours; we'll be mixing, wrapping and preparing the dough in the directions First.
</li>
        <li>Prepare your utensils, ingrediants and mixing bowls. In the first bowl Sift & Whisk in your
             All Purpose Flour, the Cake Flour, Salt, Cornstarch and Baking Soda. Whisk together until blended and Set aside.</li>
</li>
        <li>Next in a sperate bowl, mix together the Brown Sugar, White Sugar, 1 1/2 cups of melted Unsalted Butter 
            (or 3 sticks of butter, make sure it's melted and not hot), 3 Egg Yolks, 2 Whole Eggs and Vanilla Extract. Mix until blended.</li>
</li>
        <li>Gently shake in your dry mixture into the wet mixture 1/3 of the way at a time. This will get THICC, 
            so I recommend using a big spoon (not a mixer) to blend it all together. Once it's all combined, fold in the Chocolate Chunks/Chips until evenly distributed.</li>
</li>
        <li>Now you can either store the Cookie Dough in a sealed container in the fridge for 3-4hours, or you can wrap it in plastic wrap and store it in the freezer for 1-2 hours. 
            This will make the dough easier to work with allowing it to stiffen up, afterwords this makes baking a lot more even throughout the cookie.</li>
</li>
        <li>Once the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
</li>
        <li>The cookie dough is now hard but maluable, and can be made into "pinch-pots". This paticular part of the process takes patients and finger-work; 
            Form the dough into small golf-sized (2-3in diameter) bowls with a thin (1-2cm thick and 2in accross) dough lid. You should be able to easily fit 3 rows of 5 pinch-pot cookies per row.</li>
        <li>At this stage you can fill the little pots with anything you'd like inside a cookie:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Dark Chocolate</li>
            <li> Peanut Butter</li>
            <li> Nutella</li>
            <li> Marshmellow Fluff</li>
            <li> Caramel- and the list goes on</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once you have filled the pinch-pots, seal the contents inside and roll the cookie-dough ball in your hands blending the seems in. 
            Place them back on the cookie sheet and repeat. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes (depending on the filling). 
            The cookies should be golden brown on the edges and slightly soft in the middle. Let them cool for 5 minutes before serving (allowing them to stiffen).</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Bomb-A Cookies!</li>
