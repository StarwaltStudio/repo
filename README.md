My First and probably most trumendous undertaking is creating my first website.
I'm 32 as of this recording, year 2025, and I've had a lot of thought put into what I want to create.
I have some experience in coding from my experience in college, it's about time I put it to use.

What I have so far, 7/06/2025;
A index/home page, Commissions, Contact, Resume, Shop links inside a interlaced website.
I have a 4 images of drawings I made in the Resume page. Two image splits of my Home page. Also comments and descriptions on each page.

I'm currently working on Oden Project: Recipies, continuing my work with getting this done.
